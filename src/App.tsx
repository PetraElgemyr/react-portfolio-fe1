We used NodeJs and a MongoDb database with vanilla javascript. For the front-end part we used React and typescript, along with some styled components. This is our first assignment working with context and reducer combined. We also tried to work agile with daily standups and github for pull requests and branches.",

I used an old project and converted javascript to typescript and tried to refactor as much of the code as possible in the time given. This is a todo list where you can add todos through the input box or else the user will get an error message. The todo tasks can be marked as finished and can be removed to the removed list. Both the lists can be emptied and they can be sorted in alphabetical order.",
